? How to install raspbian 
# There is an app Raspbian imaging utility https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/
> Chose OS > Raspberry pi OS (other) > Raspberry pi OS (lite)
# You dont need desktop environment

? How to SSH to RPi
> Mount imaged SD card Add an empty file "ssh" into /boot/
> Connected Ethernet port of laptop and RPi
> ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
# passwd: raspberry

? Host a hotspot from RPi for OMZ to connect
> Bridge your laptop Ethernet and laptop Wifi adapter so as for the RPi to get internet
> install https://github.com/jasbur/RaspiWiFi and follow the process : SCRIPT-BASED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

? How to find OMZ ip address 
# Use same procedure to force wifi to connect to RPi hotsopt 
# feature to connect to wifi automatically is still not added
> Connect RPi usb to laptop > Open digilent-agent > Launch Wavesforms Live
> Add OMZ device, three dots > configure
> Connect to Wifi hotsopt of RPi and you would be able to see ip there.

? How to run scripts ? 
> Change url variable to ip address of RPi 
openscope.py > the entire code
stop.py > stops AWG and trigger (use this incase openscope.py gets halted in between)
check.py > checks the state of AWG ,OSC and trigger
reset.py > resets all instruments

? Acquisition: Important:
acqCount from the most recent state of OSC for example :
IN[1]  : {"osc":{"1":[{"command":"getCurrentState"}]}}
OUT[1] : 
{
    "osc": {
        "1": [
            {
                "command": "getCurrentState",
                "statusCode": 0,
                "wait": 0,
                "state": "triggered",
                "acqCount": 10,
                "actualVOffset": 0,
                "actualSampleFreq": 1000000,
                "actualGain": 0.25,
                "actualBufferSize": 32000,
                "triggerDelay": 0                
            }
        ]
    }
}

here it is 10.
use the same while reading 

IN[2] : {"osc":{"1":[{"command":"read","acqCount":10}]}}

> So you have to edit openscope.py accordingly 
NOTE: If you reset, aqcCount defaults to 1 so you don't need to change code each time
